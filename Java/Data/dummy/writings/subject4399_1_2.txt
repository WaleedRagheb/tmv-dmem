 Mutiplayer Maps [suggestion for bo3] 	 One thing i hated about all cod was being forced to play on maps i didnt like. I wish they would implement something like " map filters " giving us an option to choose which maps we want to show up. If they had this in Bo2. I wouldve definitely deselected DRONE AND OVERFLOW. i understand an option like this might have an impact on lobby match making as it would probably take longer depending if SBMM is as it is in Aw. HOWEVER, i don't think it might be an issue considering everyone knows all the bad/ugly maps and wouldn't vote for them anyway. SO, lobbies with all the great maps would show up all the time and wouldn't take long to find. do you guys think this is good idea? i know some of you will say " it will get boring after a while playing the same maps over and over ". no, if the game ships with about 12-13-14 maps, only about 2 maps at most PROBABLY wont be good. that leaves about 10 maps that will come up in rotation. i loved playing mw3, it was where i first started, if i had map filters, i'd play on dome, hardhat, mission, baakara, arkaden, seatown, village AND resistance, all day everyday.
