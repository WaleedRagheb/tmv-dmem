 So, I finally opened the bottle of Oy Vey teriyaki sauce 	 It's probably at least 6 years old, and there were a lot of solids right up near the top after I got the plastic and cap off.  Even though I shook it a bit.  So, I put the cap back on and shook the bottle harder and longer.  Well, that seemed to clear the neck of the bottle of those solids, but right away the liquid in the bottle started expanding and flowing out of the top of the bottle!  There's no stopping it, so I let some flow onto my salmon, got it stopped up and washed the outside of the bottle.  So, I cooked the salmon and ate it last night.  Am I going to die?  Also, can I eat the rest of the teriyaki sauce?
