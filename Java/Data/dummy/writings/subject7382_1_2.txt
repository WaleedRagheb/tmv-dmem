   	 It is bold, I like bold. I'll elaborate-the majority of furniture designs I've seen that are heavy on the CNC router are focused on flat-packing or complete CNC fabrication. The process of cutting out a pattern and fitting it with its infill counterpart isn't seen as much(in the scope of CNC routing furniture). The overall process of pattern/infill in furniture design has been around for ages; what makes this special is the tolerance of the CNC's measure- something like a 10,000th of an inch?
