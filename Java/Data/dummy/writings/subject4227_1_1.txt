   	 You wouldn't notice till probably a month in when your supermarket puts up signs saying either "Due to a shortage x is unavailable" or the price of the product just doubles. Unless you go to a restaurant that usually has immigrant cooks (most) then you'll just be wondering why your meal is taking so long. Cheap labor is actually vital to the united states and Americans don't want to work for those wages so you have to find immigrants who will.
