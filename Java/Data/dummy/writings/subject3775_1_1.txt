 Is a star's solar system orbital plane determined by its galactic orbital plane?   	 Looking up at the summer triangle last night I realized it contains both the star, Vega (or Altair, I've seen them both cited) to which the solar system is currently headed, and the Kepler probe field of view. Kepler detects planets that pass between their primary star and the Kepler probe/Earth/Solar System. Thus it can only see planets whose orbital plane is in line with the direction to the earth. Is it only a coincidence that we're looking at stars along the line in which our own star is traveling in its galactic orbit? Or, is there some reason to believe the orbital planes of the solar systems are lined up along their galactic orbit/velocity vectors?
