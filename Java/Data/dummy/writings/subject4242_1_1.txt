   	 My friend believes that one's spirit detaches and departs from the self when someone is on a really negative path, when one is behaving in a way that is harmful to others on a regular basis...i.e., being a bully, or a serial rapist, or an arsonist....you get the idea.  There may indeed be a *vacancy* in some people who seem to lack conscience and spirit.
