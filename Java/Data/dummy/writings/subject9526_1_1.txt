   	 Back when I was 6, I heard eminem rapping "Without Me" on the radio, and I absolutely loved it. I was never allowed to listen to his music and this crushed me. Later on I heard "'Til I Collapse" in a call of duty commercial. by that time I was 12 and I started to really get into Eminem. Im 16 now and I own all of his buyable songs and continue to enjoy/discover his very rare music and freestyles. Without Me remains one of my favorite Eminem songs of all time.
