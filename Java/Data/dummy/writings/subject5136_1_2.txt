   	 I believe I know the girl that this happened to, she was a close friend then.  If not, this exact same thing happened in a lavish house in Colorado at the same time, which isn't too unreasonable to assume.  The girl went through extreme emotional stress after.  She failed her classes, started (perhaps exacerbated) cutting herself, and had severe family trust problems after, and this is just what I know about.  That being said, you say you are a different person now.
