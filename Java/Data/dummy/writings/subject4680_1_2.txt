   	 My group always makes it so a nat 1 does damage to YOU or your allies. This isn't taken very seriously and often leads to hilarious situations (like an orc launching its sword at it's Kobold friend.) It's also one of the best moments to see the look on your friend's face as you roll a damage die to see how hard you hit them.
