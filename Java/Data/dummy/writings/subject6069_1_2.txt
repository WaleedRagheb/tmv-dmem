 Incessant Fundraising - Strongly considering Cancelling my subscription 	 Is anyone else feeling this way? It permeates every conversation that TYT has these days. I get that they're trying to make a ton of money for their investigative reporting teams, but there's a reason NPR only does periodic fundraising drives and then just has occasional mentions about donations in bumpers between shows. That reason is that it drives the listeners insane to *constantly* hear about donations and fundraising. It seems like that's all TYT has really focused on over the past few weeks, and considering they still want to raise $1.4 million more, it doesn't seem like it will be ending anytime soon. This makes me want to cancel my membership for at least a few months until this ends.
