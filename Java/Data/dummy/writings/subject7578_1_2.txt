 What importance is it, that we know where the water on the moon came from? 	 I've read a number of papers about the origin of water on the moon but one question that has persisted to evade an answer to through out, is how and why do does research get funded? What important implications does answering such a question, as to what is the origin of water on the moon, hold? Will it benefit humanity economically? Will it better constrain time frames, or conditions during the Hadean and if so why are those answers important?
