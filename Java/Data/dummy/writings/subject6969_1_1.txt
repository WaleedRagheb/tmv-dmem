 Best paint color choice? Painting a Forest Service truck 	 I'm trying to locate the best choice in color for my model, based on a Forest Service truck, picture [here](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2503/3712123884_5db122edd2_b.jpg). I've looked through the Model Paint Database, and it looks like the Model Master 1710 fits, although I'd love some guidance. I'm also wondering if there's somewhere to get decals for this type of vehicle?
