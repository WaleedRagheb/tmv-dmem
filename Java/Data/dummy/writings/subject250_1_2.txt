   	 Okay, but I'm from south Texas and you'd be surprised on the variations you hear. Some swear on marinating in lime juice overnight, while others hit it with lime after grilling and let it sit. I get it, you're from Washington and you know what asada translates to in English. Congrats! I asked for the recipe because it looked homemade.
