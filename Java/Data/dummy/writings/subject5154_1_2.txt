   	 Shutting Hormuz strait is really easy, all that Iran needs is a great ship to be sent to the bottom of the strait so that no ship can cross it at least for 6 months, U.S navy is useless in Persian Gulf for they are like apples in front of a gun waiting to be shot by Missiles, the greater the battle ships are the easier targets they are.
