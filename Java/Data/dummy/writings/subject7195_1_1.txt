   	 From my experience here, yeah, Italian countries look really fun. Florence was great because of how much money I was making at basically all points in my run. Even though I couldn't ever match the might of most big nation armies, I could sure as hell triple my standing army in mercenaries in every war. It you want more of a challenge, though, it might be worthwhile trying some other Italian minor. I've only got like 200hrs logged, so what do I know?
