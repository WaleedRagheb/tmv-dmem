 My wish list. 	 When are we going to hear from more of the principle players?  I'd like to hear an interview with the principal, the elderly neighbors, the ex boyfriend, the ex boyfriend's mom.  I'd like to hear from the 18 year old she got dumped for.  I'd like to hear from the guy that left the card in her door.  I'd like to know if anyone has any pictures from the barbecue (the principal, Troy, might)-that way we could see if she was actually wearing the necklace they found pieces of at her house.  I'd like to hear from the old drug store owner with the unique car.  I'd like a list of all the guys she was sleeping with (it might be long).  I realize the GBI probably has a lot of this already.  That's my Christmas wish list.  So interesting!
