 Lying 	 I don't believe in God or follow mormon standards anymore, but my parents don't know that. So whenever there is a youth temple trip, I lie to my bishop so that I can attend. And I also still bless the sacrament and so on. Whenever I have an interview with my bishop, I lie and say I'm worthy. Is this bad? Should I feel bad about doing this? And also, my parents are making me put a bunch of money I get from working into saving for my mission. Money that I would rather have to do other things with. What should I do?
