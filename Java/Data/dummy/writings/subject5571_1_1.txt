   	 I know that my best friends father isn't his real dad. His biological father left when he was really young and his stepfather has been there for most of his life. He hates the man, hes even stolen from him, but he  never let on to any of us the truth. We only found out one day when another friend's mother let it slip in passing. To this day no one has ever spoken to him about it. I guess it feels wrong knowing it without his permission.
