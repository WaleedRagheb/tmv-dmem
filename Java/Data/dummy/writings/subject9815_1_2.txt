 Running with my Mutt 	 Any advice for training my mutt to run with me? He's a 40lb pretty low to the ground possible pit bull mix. We put him in training for petsmart for all the basic essentials so he's pretty good at commands (especially when treated). When running though he has started tugging at the leash during the first steps or he'll shoot out in front and then get distracted and start veering not paying attention. Any advice for the leash tugging?
