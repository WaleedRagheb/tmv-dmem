   	 I get what you mean, and maybe I didn't explain it myself as well, but I mean Arrival contains aliens, which, like you said, is pure sci-fi, but it takes place in the present, there's nothing futuristic looking about the movie, other than the aliens, there's nothing that makes you say it's sci-fi. While, Blade Runner 2049 is cyberpunk, it's still a setting that instantly makes you say sci-fi, with it's futuristic setting and technology which is futuristic, and plus, the movie's about replicants, androids who look lifelike with a 4 year capacity, and while there is androids, I'm pretty sure there's no androids that are completely lifelike. You get what I mean, right?
