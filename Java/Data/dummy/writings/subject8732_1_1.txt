   	 I know very little about medicine, let alone psychiatry or neurosurgery but wouldnt it be useful to study impact of somatical diseases on psychiatric condition, especially diseases impacting the brain? Maybe then we can find zones in our brain (know nothing about neurosurgery, remember) that affects different diseases and maybe we can stimulate or operate them to cure them?
