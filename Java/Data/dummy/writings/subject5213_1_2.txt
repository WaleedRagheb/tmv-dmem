   	 Thanks for your response, a lot of it makes sense to me.  Both my SO and his brother are attractive but in different ways.  I'm not sure if he feels the same way towards me, but I know he's had some relationship troubles in the past and I've wondered if maybe he wants something similar to what Will and I have.
