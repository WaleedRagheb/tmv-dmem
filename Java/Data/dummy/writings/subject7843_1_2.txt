   	 That's a good insight. I wondered the same thing. I've thought myself that (like most real people who experience NDE or OBEs) that this is place is another Astral plane or dimension that parellels the one she exists in already. I've read a lot of books on OBEs and most always they mention Astral Projection. So traveling around Saturn is completely possible in an Astral projection experience.
