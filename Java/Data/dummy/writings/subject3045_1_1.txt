   	 I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion, but did anyone else think Shyamalan could have handled the childhood flashbacks scenes better? I understand Casey being molested is a part of her character and it's what saved her from the Beast, but that one flashback in particular was just too much for me. I didn't need to see a grown man strip naked in the woods and get on all fours like some greasy pedobear. That was just fucked up.
