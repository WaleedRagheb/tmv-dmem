   	 Yes I think HD is overrated. I am not a film maker, but it strikes me that film making is a highly technical activity. Occassionaly the technical challenges lead to some creative breakthrough, where a director and his/her team find a new way to tell the story and it works beautifully. The downside is that the industry can get too obsessed with technology, and the basics of narrative art get pushed into the background. 3D might be an example of this phenomenon. A film can be a staggering technological achievement, adored by industry insiders who can 'see' the technique, and can leave an audience completely cold. I'm sure HD has added a great deal to cinema on one level, but it's not why people go to the movies or watch them at home. I think cinema's constant striving for technological advancement goes back to its roots though. The very first moving pictures were enjoyed simply because of the illusion the technology created. It was a great novelty, and film will always be looking out for the next novelty.
