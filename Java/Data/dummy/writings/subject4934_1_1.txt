 [No spoilers] Are there any collectors editions or just plain beautiful hardback versions of ASOIAF or a great collection to own? 	 So I have the first book and I've began to read after 4 years of saying I will but I'm a big, big fan of collecting and owning the upgraded version(so to speak) of the normal books. So right now I have the paperback version of a game of thrones with just the plain sand colour and dragon on the front. What other versions can I buy?
