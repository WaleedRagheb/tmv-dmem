   	 I will admit being an atheist used to make me sad. For most of my life I selfishly believed in an afterlife that would preserve my mind after death. Even when I was an agnostic, I still held onto this notion of the afterlife. But after doing some deep thinking and reading some books on atheism (notably "The God Delusion" and "God is not Great") I realized that the afterlife is a myth but that is not exactly as bad a thing as I thought it would be. I feel now that I have been lucky enough to be born and given a chance to experience life. While the ending is not pleasant, I know every moment leading up to it I will celebrating and enjoying life. Sometimes the end makes you enjoy the journey more.
