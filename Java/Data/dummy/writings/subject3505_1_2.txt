   	 I like this idea. Using an $85 outdoor antenna, I get more than 70 programming channels over the air for free from local broadcast signals. I might be interested in supplementing that with an inexpensive selection of cable TV channels. I am NOT interested in paying retran fees to local stations for broadcast signals I can receive over the air. Making OTA broadcast services a streaming option for those who can't get a broadcast signal is the right approach.
