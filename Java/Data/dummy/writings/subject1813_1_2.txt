   	 Had this teacher in high school who was pretty built.  Almost every time we had an assembly they would use those crappy plastic chair.  Well, the chairs would always be fine for him for the first half of getting up and sitting down... but eventually EVERY DAMN TIME you just hear a snap and a crash, followed by a roar of laughter because the chair broke under him.  I think I saw it happen to him at least 4 times.  I don't understand why he didn't just stand the entire time
