   	 I'm doing this right now with the Forbidden Woods. I was tired of getting rekt by ~~my crippling fear of snakes~~ literally everything so I'm taking some time of to play Skyrim and will bounce back in with a refreshed mind and determination. This worked wonders for me in Latria as well with Demon's Souls.
