   	 I stumbled home from a work party and proceeded to lock myself in my water heater closet at my apartment; I couldn't see a damn thing. In my drunken stupor, I kicked the pipe at the bottom and busted it off the heater, which proceeded to start filling said closet with scalding hot water. At this point the drunken panic sets in: I find the door and push the handle and it won't budge. I begin to think I'm going to die as the scalding water and steam start to fill this 4' x 4' closet, so in my state of drunken adrenaline I grab the heater, rip it off the pipes, and start ramming the door in hopes that it would open. In realizing it won't and thinking I'm going to die, I lay against the wall in defeat. I turn the handle one more time with tears streaming down my face...I pull the handle and it opens without a problem. When I was trying to open said door the first time, I tried pushing only...$2,000 and an eviction notice later, still the dumbest (and weirdest) thing I've done while drunk.
