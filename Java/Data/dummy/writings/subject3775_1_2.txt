 Are significant numbers of military members illegal voters in the states where they live? 	 With the recent controversies where republican controlled states have sought to purge the voter rolls of "illegal voters", most of whom happen to be in heavily democratic party voting populations, it got me wondering about military voters, of whom there are quite a few in swing states such as virginia and colorado. Military members can choose to be residents of any state in the country, called their "home of record" in their military records. Many military members take advantage of this to make their home of record one of the states that do not have a state income tax. Yet they live in and consume government services such as public schools, roads, etc. funded by state taxes in the state where they reside. Military members are also supposed to only register to vote in their "home of record" state, voting with absentee ballots. Military members also tend as a group to vote heavily republican. So in these republican controlled states where they have been seeking to purge the voter rolls of illegal voters, have they been cross checking voter rolls with military records or state income tax records to determine whether military members have registered to vote in the local state elections without changing their home of record? Does the military verify its members have not registered to vote in a state different from their home of record? Is this a potentially large population of illegal voters?
