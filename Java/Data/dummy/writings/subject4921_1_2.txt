 How to analyze for contaminants in decellularized matrices? 	 A co-worker asked if they can analyze their decelluarized matrix for contamination with EDTA and triton x-100 via HPLC.  Detecting those molecules should be straight forward, the only thing that I'm not sure about is how to go about processing the samples.  I don't see why those molecules shouldn't just be simply soluble in water (so just soak the matrices in water for a while?) OR if the problem is that triton x-100 and EDTA get trapped in the matrix.  Is there some sort of matrix digestion or hydrolysis that should be done?  The issue then is if you digest the matrix and need to use some sort of enzyme, you might need EDTA buffered solutions for that which might also contain a touch of detergent as well.  If the former method should work where we just try soak the decellularized materials in water, should we precipitate proteins out before HPLC injection?  A simple RP-C18 column should work from what I am gathering.
