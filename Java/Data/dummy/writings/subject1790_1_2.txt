 Disney supports sun worship? 	 So I heard this a while ago and rolled my eyes at the stupidity of it. I was curious if anyone on this website has encountered a conspiracy of Disney putting symbols in their movies to get adjust people to the worship of "sun gods" that they are (somehow) going to force on us. Also, I would search this out but I don't hate myself enough at the moment to go through with that.
