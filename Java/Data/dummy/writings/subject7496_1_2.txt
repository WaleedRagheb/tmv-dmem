   	 As you know Java apps on PC run on Java virtual machine. Android apps runs on Dalvik VM (you write them in Java then Java bytecode is translated to dalvik bytecode), for simplicity you may think about Dalvik as Java VM optimized for mobile devices. That's why you use Java as default language, it is why ppl tell apps written in Java as native apps, cos Android was designed to use apps written in Java primarily. Original Java VM can use not only Java but also native code (for example C) via JNI, this feature was also added to Dalvik and you use it with help of NDK. So you have Android SDK for apps in Java and Android NDK for c/c++ support in your app (it's harder than java development so learn that later). Other solutions are apps like 'webpage' in WebView that are just pages trying to be apps (here you can use HTML etc), there are also other frameworks that may use Python/Lua code and change app via exposed API, there are also solutions based on translating for example ruby to native projects. Another solution is running any JVM-based language as 'Java' apps for example Scala or Clojure. So to sum things up, you have full freedom, but for begging choose Java if you are familiar with this language or other easy frameworks based on Javascript if you have problems with Java, it's somehow problem of preferences. Personally I'd go with Java at start cos for me it's easier to fight with language than with tools and for Java for Android you have much more tutorials and better IDE support.
