   	 I noticed some portions of the Earth 101 video included portions from another video which is related to this, as it was published alongside a study, "[Record Balkan floods of 2014 linked to planetary wave resonance](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501428)," co-authored by Rahmstorf. A descriptive, illustrated, video was published on youtube to help explain the studies findings: [Rossby waves and extreme weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzW5Isbv2A0 ).
