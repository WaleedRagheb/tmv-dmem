   	 For what it's worth, I was one of these overly attached children and turned out okay. But, the behaviour stems from insecurity. You should Google "attachment styles" - the child is exhibiting classic insecure attachment patterns and you should figure out where it is coming from. The best thing you and your girlfriend can do is provide a stable, nurturing environment for the child with a lot of routine. It is equally important for the parents to be regarded by the child as secure and stable themselves. This means no drama, excessive drinking/ drug use/ partying/ etc. Parents need to be parents. The child needs to learn that when they go to the sitter, it is only for a little while, and mom will be there at the end of the day. Be specific, firm - but loving - and make it a routine. The child will eventually get the hang of it.
