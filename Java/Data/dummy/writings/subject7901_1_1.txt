   	 The desperate clutching for measures to restore Confidence does not inspire confidence.  The discipline of the market -- letting credit markets collapse -- is the cure that kills the patient.  The alternative being proposed is "unlimited funding" -- the abandonment of all market discipline. That could lead to unlimited indebtedness which gets monetized into unlimited inflation.  But probably the funding will be restrained by a political imposition, allocating funding in accord with political power.  This is where international democratic socialism starts to look like a less corrupt, more transparent way to go (a la Syriza in Greece).  Stay tuned.
