   	 I don't want to overwhelm you with a long list, but if you want to see some good stuff with an edge, check out CHASER and YELLOW SEA. Na Hong-jin is my favorite Asian film director at the moment. He's up there with Chan-Wook Park (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance), Kim Jee-woon (I saw the Devil).... by the way, check out a movie called JSA, as well! Hope I helped!
