   	 I was actually really dissociated for a while, so I really didn't think or feel much when I cut myself. It was kind of like an attempt for me to get back to reality, but I just couldn't do it. Everything about the blood and the pain and the endorphins gave me a little bit of a high before I dropped back in to my zombie-like state.
