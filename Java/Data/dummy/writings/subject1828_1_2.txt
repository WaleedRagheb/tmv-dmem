   	 As the original poster of the Guinness ad, here's what I know:  Nothing.  It was there at #7 when I went home from work about 5:30 CST, my friend told me it was up to #2 a few hours later when it disappered.  I have retained my karma points from the post, but there is no record of it existing in my account and no message from reddit.  Your guess is as good as mine.
