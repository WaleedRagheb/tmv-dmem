   	 Caesar is the next straw hat and I doubt he will be stronger than he already is. People like usopp and nami will never be vice admiral level. Oda has said that its in there character to be weak. Franky or brook are probably going to be only slightly vice admiral level. Look at smoker, nami or usopp can never be that strong. It would be game breaking to their character
