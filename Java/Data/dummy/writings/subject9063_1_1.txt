 IAmA Cook at Swiss Chalet, bored on the job AMA! 	 I have been working at swiss chalet for around 2 years full time for 1. I worked my way up from washing dishes to line and then eventually to full time cooking. My job is getting to the restaurant 4 hours before everyone else and cooking the chicken, ribs, rices, soups, and blanching the fries. I know pretty much everything there is to know about swiss chalet food-wise and am actually on the job right now (Mondays are very slow) ask me anything you'd like to know about swiss chalet food!
