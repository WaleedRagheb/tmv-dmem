   	 First off, stay away from Chauvet. They're notorious for breaking and not lasting long. A fairly cheap solution would be to get Luminair for iOS and hook your lights up via art net to Ethernet so you can control your lights via iOS. Luminair is incredibly easy to use. Try out controlbooth.com for a forum on lighting and sound. Those guys are awesome. I've been doing lighting for a while but I don't know a simple controller for that cheap. Maybe the guys at CB will have a suggestion. Best of luck.
