 My (30M) formerly CF wife (28F) has been diagnosed with depression. Since then, she's decided that she wants to be a SAHM and is pressuring me to have my vasectomy reversed. Advice wanted. 	 I don't think she's manipulating me. She's never said "give me children or I'm leaving". She just let me know its important to her - which is weird, because it never has been before.
