 Having issues with a game update. 	 It's 10$ from what I was told, but only 4$ will go towards the Stylo so I get ~6 off my normal bill. Downside is I can't pay the Stylo off early, from what I was told, or I lose the bill credit. I was thinking of paying the last 110'ish off and pocketing the 24 months of 10$ off haha.
