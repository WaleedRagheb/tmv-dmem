   	 Uh, I feel you. I just joined the group, and was in the same situation. Stopped bc on August 14, got a period on Aug. 17, then nothing until December 1st (106 days)... It's really frustrating not knowing if you're even ovulating at all, and wondering how long the next cycle will be... I saw my doctor after 2.5 months and she didn't seem worried, but I'm not the most patient person, so good luck to you!
