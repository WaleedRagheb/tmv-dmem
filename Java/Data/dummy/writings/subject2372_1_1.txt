 Has anyone here done the RIBA Part 2 at Cambridge? 	 I'm interested in applying as I hear its heavily writing based, which I enjoy and is my strong suit, but would be interested in hearing former students opinions how well rounded the course is. How well did you feel it prepared you for the working world? My main hesitation is that with the greatly above average commitment to write four 5,000 word essays and a 15,000 word thesis that there would be less time to build the practical skills necessary in working life after I graduate. Do the other aspects of the course balance it out?
