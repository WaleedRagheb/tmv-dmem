   	 I'm so pale I'm almost translucent and I use the Hard Candy Glamouflage concealer. It's liquid and covers everything (I think it was originally made for tattoos). I'm Canadian as well so it's available here, and it was about $5 at Walmart. My skin has more yellow/neutral tones though, but they have a few shades so if you can find yours I'd definitely recommend!
