   	 They are my children's first and middle initials, yes I have 5.  I had a drawing of a Celtic design that had 6 points in it that were much smaller.  I wanted it to look like it was cut out of my skin.  Brian took it and revamped it into what you see here.  Now that I have it I'm contemplating having him design a full sleeve for my forearm that will incorporate this into it.
