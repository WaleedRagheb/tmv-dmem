   	 I just quit smoking after 15 yrs of a two pack aday habit. It's been 5 days since my last cigarette. The answer is the E-Cig..it creates smoke sounds and looks like cigarette. It's unreal but it can be found at every 7/11 store the company is called N-Joy. The starter kit with charger and everything u need will be $19. Refills are damn cheap. I living in Chicago paid $16 a day for 2 packs. I've only spent the $19 for the past 5 days. I never thought I could quit, the E-Cig proved me wrong!!!
