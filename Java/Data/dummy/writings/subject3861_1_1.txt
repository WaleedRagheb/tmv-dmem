   	 Around the time of the Ming, they were sending around massive fleets at far as East Africa to exact tribute. So what if they would have looked to the east and found America before Columbus? Would it be feasible? How would that turn out? Would they establish colonies like Europe, or default to their historical tendencies to establish vassals/ tributary states? If they did establish colonies, how would they respond to dynastic changes, particularly the fall of the Ming?
