   	 Ahh, after reading about it, I've gathered that you were likely poisoned by whomever yelled at the children, the question remains then, why did the doctors say you were always there? Or you were poisoned as a child and therefore technically HAVE always been there... That would be a nightmare experience, though it appears you are one of the very rare and lucky few to have recovered, time for some sweet sweet revenge c;
