 Starting college in September to study drums for four years, and looking to upgrade to a better kit from my beginner one I've been playing since I started seven years ago. What are some great mid range kits, around $900-1300, and where should I look for second hand kits? 	 I've heard so many good things about that kit, I always played one for my exams in the School of Music I did my grades in. Would it be a good kit for a player who plays mostly harder rock stuff, as in letlive. and heavier Led Zeppelin sort of style?
