   	 Wow! Thanks everyone for all the great feedback! I created this playlist a while ago mainly for my own listening pleasure. However, after hearing positive reviews from some friends I decided to share it on here for others to enjoy. It started out as a playlist of mostly recognizable rock/alternative songs and then I slowly started implementing some hip hop in there as well. The playlist will be updated regularly to my best ability. I will also be experimenting with more playlists of different genres and themes. Enjoy!
