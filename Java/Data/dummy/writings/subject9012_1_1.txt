   	 I really like the ["Thumtrac" Birdie by Innova.](http://www.innovadiscs.com/discs/putt-and-approach-discs/speed-1/birdie.html) It's great for aggressive putting and the grip, well it's in the name. I've only heard about them until a recent trip to Sports Authority. I picked one up for $10 and the accuracy I have with this thing is literally unbelievable. It's definitely worth a gander. All I used pryor was my Aviar and I loved it. The Birdie has improved my putt and approach game so much that it's the clear choice over the Aviar for me.
