 Renting a room out of some lady's house over Craigslist. We didn't sign a contract. Do I still have to give 30 days notice? 	 The reason I said it was because one of the side effects is nausea and I was so sick yesterday I was bedridden. I didn't want to come across as faking it, so I just admitted I'm on meds and the doctor upped my dosage. But now  I think he might mistake it for something worse like schizophrenia. I work at an office job, one of those jobs that you need a college degree for, so I can't just find a new job easily.
