   	 I might be wrong but wouldn't Tony's friendship with Hannah have warranted him a positive mention on the tapes, kind of like Clay? (Especially since she clearly trusted him enough to leave the tapes with him?) Or did Clay got a mention because she had a crush on him and felt bad that her experience with Justin had caused this rift between them?
