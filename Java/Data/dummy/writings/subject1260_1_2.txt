 Questioning my faith how do you explain this? 	 So I have been questioning the existence of the Christian God, but there are a few things that are hard for me to look over. Such as about a year ago a elderly man came up to me and told me God told him what was going on in my life and sure enough he told me every detail. However he told me things I hadnt told people such as self harming etc. God told him to tell me that God loves me and I should stop doing it. How would you explain that without faith?
