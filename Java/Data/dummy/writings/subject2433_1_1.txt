 Is it possible to stop being introverted and turn into an extrovert? 	 College right now. But I'm on summer break and lonely because I'm having trouble making friends at home. I never made any friends in highschool, and it was much easier to make friends in college because of clubs and stuff. my college friends also don't live nearby.
