   	 I checked my address (and a few other neighborhoods) in Houston and found that I am eligible for "up to" 18 Mbs for only $65/month. Oh, and there is a 250 GB data cap. So instead describing of fiber to the premises, this announcement seems to be mostly "fiber to the press release". It is not a product most folks in these cities can buy.
