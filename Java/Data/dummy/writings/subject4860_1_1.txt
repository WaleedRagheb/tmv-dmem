   	 China is illegally laying claim on a large part of North-Eastern state and along Northern border with India, which is conventionally and historically well demarcated. Significantly they are not ready to settle the border issue ever and keep it pending for so that land hungry China may lay claim on more areas in future, besides what they are occupying in PoK, gifted to them by their friend Pakistan. Ironically China don't recognize the Mc Mohan line of border demarcation settled by the British Indian government. But they recognize the dotted line of their border on the water bed of South China Sea.
