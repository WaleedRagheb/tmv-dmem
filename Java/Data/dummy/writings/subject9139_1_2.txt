   	 Yes, I have been on antidepressants for two years now. I have worked with several therapists and I saw a psychiatrist regularly for about a year. I strongly wanted the therapy to work, I gave it my best and it just wasn't enough. The medication (Prozac) did help a lot in the beginning, but when I started feeling worse again and I went to the doctor, he simply doubled my dose. This didn't work at all and I went through hell trying to go back to the original dose, 20 mgs, which is what I am taking now.
