   	 Avoid statements such as "let me know if there's anything I can do to help" and instead rephrase them as direct questions like "what can I do today that would help you?" It's important to be there for them rather than just saying you will be and then blatantly prioritizing other things. Probably the most important thing, though, is to make sure they know that you're not disappointed in them for having to come home early and that it isn't their fault. It's really easy to feel inadequate and somehow worth less than other missionaries when your attempt to serve the Lord is ruined by something not under your control. Becoming an ERM is a very emotionally taxing and stressful experience--I did it less than a month ago, and even though coming home was exactly what I wanted, it was still hard, and I HATED my mission. Can't imagine how awful it feels for somebody much more invested than I was.
